<h1>LicenseView</h1>

A quick little library I made, because I needed to add Licenses to my app.
The only solutions I could find on the internet they used Webviews. I didn't want to make use of a webview so that's why I made this library, as a fun little side project.

To add the LicenseView to a layout.
```xml
<com.larswerkman.licenseview.LicenseView
	android:id="@+id/licenseview"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">
```

Adding the License xml to the LicenseView.

```java
LicenseView licenseView = (LicenseView) findViewById(R.id.licenseView1);
try {
	licenseView.setLicenses(R.xml.licenses);
} catch (NotFoundException e1) {
} catch (XmlPullParserException e1) {
} catch (IOException e1) {
}
```	
Creating the License xml. first add a folder called 'xml' to your Resource folder 'res', then create a file called licenses.xml (Or the name you want).
This is a sample file how it should be structured.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<licenses>
    <license name="android-support-v4.jar" type="file">

```

The root tag should always be called ```xml<licenses>``` and the child tag ```xml<license>``` .
The license tag has 2 attributes ```xml name``` and ```xml<type>```.

The name specifies the name of the library.
The type attribute can be 2 things, either ```xml file``` or ```xml library``` depending if its a jar or a project.
